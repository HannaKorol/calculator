<!--  1) Create function add, subtract, multiply and divide;
             1.1) Test this function in console;
   2) Calculation consists:                                              
     a number,                                                                   //add className="number"
     an operator,                                                                //add className="operator"
      and another number;                                                        
   3) Create three variables for each of the parts of a calculator operation.
   4)Create a new function "operate" that takes "an operator" and "2 numbers" and then calls one of the above functions on the numbers. 
   5)Create a basic HTML calculator with "buttons for each digit", each of the above functions and an “Equals” key.
   5.1)There should also be a display for the calculator.
   5.2)Add a “clear” button
   6)Create the functions that populate the display when you click the number buttons. 
   6.1) You should be storing the ‘display value’ in a variable somewhere for use in the next step.
   7)You’ll need to store the first number and second number that are input into the calculator, utilize the operator that the user selects, and then operate() on the two numbers when the user presses the “=” key. 
   7.1)You should already have the code that can populate the display, so once operate() has been called, update the display with the ‘solution’ to the operation.
   7.2)Store all the values and call the operate function with them. 
   8)Round answers with long decimals so that they don’t overflow the screen.
   9)Pressing = before entering all of the numbers or an operator could cause problems!
   10) Pressing “clear” should wipe out any existing data.
   11) Display an error message if the user tries to divide by 0
   12) 12.3.56.5. It is hard to do math on these numbers. (disable the decimal button if there’s already one in the display)
   13) Add a “backspace” button, so the user can undo if they click the wrong number.
   14) Add keyboard support! -->
